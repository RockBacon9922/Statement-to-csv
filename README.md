# Statement-to-csv

I wrote some code to help my family go through 500 pages worth of bank statements so that they could be imported into excel for data processing.

If you want to replicate run the files 1by1 on a pdf full of bank statments.

Any files it can't process you will have to give the program a little helping hand.
