# Statement-to-csv

I built this program to help move entries from a bank statement to a csv so that It could be easily analysed.
In my case I had over 500 pages worth of bank statements which this set of programs were able to easiliy sort through and combine them into a single csv document.

If you might find this useful run the files in order on a pdf full of bank statments.

Any files it can't process you will have to give the program a little helping hand.
